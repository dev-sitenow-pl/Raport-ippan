  "text1": "In light of the above, we propose an evolution from the Western-centric model of societal development (which emphasises economic growth, takes societal happiness as the end state, and is driven by psychological individualism) to a culturally sensitive model of societal development. This new model recognises a variety of pathways of societal development, adopts cultu¬rally defined concepts of subjective well-being as an end state, and is driven by psychological civicness. In the face of pressing global challenges and the need for collabo-rative efforts to address them, the study of societal development and well-being in a culturally sensitive and sustainable manner seems not only relevant but imperative.",
  "blockquote": "People can live a good life in a variety of ways; there are numerous recipes for societal flourishing. Policy-making and research on societal development should take into account the diversity of cultural contexts and expectations. Our empirical research demonstrates that across cultures, lay expectations towards societal development generally prioritise various social aspects of modernisation. Therefore, by adopting a culturally sensitive paradigm, policy-makers can effectively fine-tune policies to indigenous visions without a significant risk of halting modernisation.",
