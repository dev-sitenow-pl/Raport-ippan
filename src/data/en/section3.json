  "text1": "Social sciences suggest that social development should be measured by changes in social well-being. However, measuring well-being accurately and reliably is a challenge. Cultures differ in their understanding and valuation of concepts such as well-being or happiness. As a result, popular simplistic rankings that compare happiness between countries provide an incomplete picture of social well-being.In Western culture it is often equated with happiness, but in other cultures it is interpreted differently and has many components. The pursuit of happiness is particularly characteristic of Western cultural societies and less so of other cultural groups. According to the authors of the study, this may be influenced by the mild climate of Western Europe and the resulting low existential pressure compared to other regions of the world. Satisfaction with life can be achieved in different ways in different parts of the world. In the Confucian culture of Asia, harmony is valued, whereas in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East or Latin America, religiosity and spirituality are valued, so visions of the good life may differ Social policy-making institutions should measure quality of life and well-being on the basis of indicators that take account of cultural diversity in order to provide a more reliable picture of the good life in different cultural contexts.

  "title2": "PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE WELL-BEING",
  "text2": "Well-being is an essential element of social development; it should be culturally sensitive, but also sustainable. Tackling climate change, eradicating poverty or ensuring decent living condiÂ¬tions are essential actions for the well-being of present and future societies. Meeting these challenges requires integrated action and cooperation at many complex levels, which is not always easy to achieve. The goals of different countries, groups and individuals may differ, but their harmonisation is crucial for the future of our planet. A study by researchers at SWPS University in Poland clearly shows that individuals' beliefs have a significant impact on their motivation to pursue common goals, and that a sense of community and convergence of priorities can provide motivation to engage in global challenges. According to the researchers, shaping the right narrative can inspire and build commitment to act for a better future for all.",
